# Energy Model
Agent-based model for household-decision making on energy saving methods, specifically: installation of PV panels.
The purpose of the energy model is to investigate the effects of modelling informal institutions in the context of agent-based models. The energy model focuses specifically on changes in estimated greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and investment related to PV panel installation by households in the Netherlands.

The model contains three types of household decision-making modules: rational, behavioral and behavioral with social influence. In the rational decision-making, agents only consider the financial aspects of installing PV panels, whereas the behavioral decision-making process follows the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) in which agents based their decisions also on their attitude towards the behavior and on subjective norms, which refer to the opinions and actions of others. In addition, it is possible to add opinion dynamics to the model, in which social influence affects the previously mentioned attitudes of the households.

The model can be run from the `run.py` file, in which the user can specify the number of runs and agents, as well as the type of decision-making and whether to include opinion dynamics or not.
